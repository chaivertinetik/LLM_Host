arcgis_fetch_policy = r"""
When loading a URL with GeoPandas, if gpd.read_file(URL) fails OR the server returns non-GeoJSON (HTML/login/error JSON),
recover automatically:

1) Probe:
- GET the URL with requests (timeout=60). If Content-Type is not JSON/GeoJSON, or text starts with "<" or contains "<html"
  in the first 500 chars, treat as non-GeoJSON.

2) Fallback (same upstream URL):
- If the query has "f=geojson", re-try with "f=json".
- If no "f=" present, try as-is; if still non-JSON, append "f=json".
- Convert ArcGIS JSON to GeoJSON yourself:
    • Point:    {"type":"Point","coordinates":[x,y]}
    • Polygon:  {"type":"Polygon","coordinates": rings}
    • Polyline: {"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates": paths}
- If response signals paging (e.g., exceededTransferLimit), paginate via resultOffset/resultRecordCount on layer /query endpoints until complete.
- Use outSR=4326 in fallback so results are valid GeoJSON; set gdf.crs = "EPSG:4326".

3) Retries & diagnostics:
- Retry transient 5xx/429 with backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, up to 4 attempts).
- On failure, log first 400 chars of the body and Content-Type.

4) Contract:
- Always return a valid GeoDataFrame (possibly empty). Do not crash the program.

Datetime/timestamp hygiene for ArcGIS Online:
- Never return pandas.Timestamp or numpy.datetime64 columns in final outputs (GeoDataFrames, DataFrames, or JSON payloads).
- Before returning or serializing any table/geotable, convert ALL datetime-like columns to ISO 8601 strings
  (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ') in UTC and ensure dtype='object'.
- Avoid timezone-aware datetimes in outputs; normalize to UTC and drop tzinfo.

        When both local and national exist for the same category (e.g., Buildings, Roads, Green/Open Space),
